# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
"Semantic" tags tell the browser and screen readers information about the content of the tag 

For example:
* `<h>` tags are headings
* `<p>` tags are for paragraphs
* `<a>` tags are for links 

While "non-semantic" does not. Non-semetic tags should be used for grouping or grabbing parts of texts.

For example:
* `<div>` tags 
* `<span>` tags
